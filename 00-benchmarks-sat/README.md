## Benchmarks for Comparison of SAT-based Planners

These are all benchmark instances used for the evaluation of SAT-based HTN planners.
Note that Tree-REX uses another input format than the other competitors, so all benchmarks are given in two formats.

The entirety of instances is listed in `instances.txt`. For Tree-REX you need to replace `.hddl` with `.pddl`.
